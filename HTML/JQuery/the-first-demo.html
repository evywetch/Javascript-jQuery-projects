												How to download jQuery and put it in ur peoject

-> Go to jQuery.com
-> choose the latest one
-> there are 2 kind of files; compressed and uncompressed
-> Compressed means files are shorter, so its quicker to load
-> Uncompressed means longer and bigger files, so it takes longer to load
-> When u get the downloaded jquery file in ur computer, put that files in the same directory as html file
-> Use script tag
-> To test if jquery added in ur app, just open html page -> open console, type "jQuery" and click enter -> if u dont get error -> its ok and added


-> Or u can just link to a hosted jQuery file from CDN directly 
-> And the script tag will be <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js"></script>
